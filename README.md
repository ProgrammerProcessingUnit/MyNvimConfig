# My Vim or Neovim Config
This is the vim config that I use for my workflow. It can also used for neovim


Note that these configurations needs atleast vim version 8.0.0(or greater) or Neovim version 0.5.0 (or greater).

It took me so long to configure these in my neovim. I don't want this to happen to you. Vim is so powerful and using these configurations will surely make it even more powerful.

if there are any changes that needs to be made to this to make it even more powerful. Please, you are most welcome :-)




# Installation :-

1) First of all, you need to install vim-plug to make these things work.

https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

2) Copy the content from vim-config file (Use vim configuration file for vim and neovim configuration file for neovim)
and paste it in your vimrc file of init.vim file.

3) Next open your vim or neovim, (You might get many error messages, Ignore them because they are more likely to be an error because we haven't installed the plugins. Just Ignore them. They will disappear after we have installed our plugins).

4) Type the command :PlugInstall in your vim or neovim. 

5) Vim-Plug will show some messages of installation. After everything is complete, Restart vim or neovim. Then see the magic.
