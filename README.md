# MyNvimConfig
This is the vim (Nvim) config that I use for my workflow


Note that these configurations needs atleast vim version 8.0.0(or greater) or Neovim version 0.5.0 (or greater).

It took me so long to configure these in my neovim. I don't want this to happen to you. Vim is so powerful and using these configurations will surely make it even more powerful.

if there are any changes that needs to be made to this to make it even more powerful. Please, you are most welcome :-)
